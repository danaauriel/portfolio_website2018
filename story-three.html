He sat on a bench,
</p>
<p>
with his hair being a mess,
</p>
<p>
reading a blue book,
</p>
<p>
He watched the night sparkle,
</p>
<p>
as his blue book turned black.
</p>
<p>
He sat in silence,
</p>
<p>
with his book in his hand.
</p>
<p>
His big smile was gone.
</p>
<p>
It faded into the night,
</p>
<p>
and turned as black as the book.
</p>
<p>
A figure sat down,
</p>
<p>
humming a beautiful tune.
</p>
<p>
He looked up at her.
</p>
<p>
He saw her bright scarlet eyes,
</p>
<p>
sensed her trustworthy aura.
</p>
<p>
She smiled at him.
</p>
<p>
He stared into her bright eyes.
</p>
<p>
The darkness faded.
</p>
<p>
The light began to come back,
</p>
<p>
and she became all he knew.
</p>
<p>
They talked for hours.
</p>
<p>
It started with a hello.
</p>
<p>
She became his world.
</p>
<p>
His entire world consumed
</p>
<p>
by the girl with scarlet eyes.
